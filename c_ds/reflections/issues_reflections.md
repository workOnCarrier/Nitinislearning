## Issue 1

* Did not think through and decided to code
* This is coming from a short-cut - since I do not remember, lot me try and see what is the behavior and adapt
* This is coming from not putting in the right amount of effort to learn
* Action plan -- code more and go to basics to find more points to remember instead of using observation on the fly.
