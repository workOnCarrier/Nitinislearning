# LibreOffice python exchange integration
## Functionality
* This should be able to pull market data from exchagne into LibreOfficeCalc (Calc)
* This enables to pull historical orders and trades from the exchange of choice into Calc
## files used for this
* open_office_calc.py
* start_libre_office.py
## Roadblocks
* only the python verion packaged inside the LibreOffice suit is usable... that seems a bit of a restriction
