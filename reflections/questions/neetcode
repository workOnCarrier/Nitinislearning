# Remove node from end of linked list
* use dummy node technique
* dummy = ListNode(0, head)
* progress cur n times
* then progress cur and pre together till cur is None/NULL
* pre -- will reach a node which is pre to the node to be removed
* pre.next = pre.next.next

# Deep Copy linked list with random pointer
* create a hashmap on the current node a key with new node as value
* second pass 
*  using next and random pointers as keys 
*  connect the nodes under current pointer
* return from the hashmap the value of head
