What Can You Do To Prepare?
This part is short and sweet. Practice.

Build something from scratch and on your own in a language you like. Don’t stop short. Build the whole thing. Make yourself do the parts that are hard for you and don’t accept half-finished code just because you think you know how you would finish it. Dive deep into the layers of the libraries and language that you built it upon, and understand how they work too.

When you think you are done show it to the smartest people you know, get feedback, tear it down and build it again with what you’ve learned.

Repeat with a new problem.

We are looking for people to build real things with us, and practice really does make perfect.
