## Issue 1 -- coding
* Did not think through and decided to code
* This is coming from a short-cut - since I do not remember, let me try and see what is the behavior and adapt
* This is coming from not putting in the right amount of effort to learn
* Action plan -- code more and go to basics to find more points to remember instead of using observation on the fly.

## Issue 2 -- no drive
* Points in resume that I do not have command on -- make me uncomfortable unless I have programmed with it

## Issue 3 -- Low self esteem
* I talk in terms of tasks and projects -- Need to switch thinking in terms of needs of a team that owns the platform.

## Issue 4 -- Modern C++ rampup gaps
* C++ 11 features
* C++ 17 features
* C++ 20 features
* C++23 features

## Issue 5 -- incorrect visualization
* I usually approach the problem by replicating the problem with steps I think in the first attempt V/S solving the problem mathematically
